# FrontEnd_Currency_Convert_Widget

This simple front-end site is to demonstrate the use of AngularJS through developing a currency conversion widget on a generic online store interface.

The widget is placed at the right edge of the interface, however the user may also access it within individual store items on the page.

The site generally follows Material design pattern, is fully responsive and optimized for cross-browser.

Lastly, a bit explaination for placing the widget as a side bar item:
The main reason is I expect more needs for widgets on a online store than a just a currency conversion widget, there will be other functionalities necessary to assist the user while he/she browse through products. All those functionlities will reside in the side bar and making it a widget hub.

## Development Info
All code are written in Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3.

Javascript framework AngularJS 1.6 is heavily used, as well as Bootstrap UI.

In addition, Font-Awesome is also slightly used.

There are comments in code regarding specific develop&design choices.

## TODOs
Implement the functionality to globally trigger the conversion, so that all items on page can be convert into another currency by one click

For the widgets within each individual store items, having the price auto-populated when the widget opens up.

Optimize the mobile UX by removing the widget as a side bar item, place it at somewhere else that doesn't block the page.
